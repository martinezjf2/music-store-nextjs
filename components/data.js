      "No one can deny that the 4-string electric bass guitar is a cornerstone of any band. Together with the percussion, the bassist creates the powerful rhythm that gets the audience moving and becomes the heartbeat of a melody. Being the most common type of bass guitar, the 4-string is essentially the gold standard instrument for the low end, and it's usually tuned to the sound of a double bass. One of the most important things to consider when choosing your new 4-string bass is the body style, and with that, the tonewood that it's made of. For a country or folk bassist looking for rich acoustic character, a semi-hollow body is the perfect way to warm up your tone right from the start. Solid-body basses, on the other hand, are right at home in any genre of music, particularly rock and metal. For either style bass, take a careful look at the wood. Alder is a popular choice due to its well-rounded tone, while a musician looking for added warmth and smoothness might prefer mahogany. If you're a technical player looking for tight sustain to nail fast bass lines, basswood may be right for you.",
      "On the other hand, high-sustain lovers will appreciate the brilliance of maple. Once you've decided on your favorite tonewood, the next step in shaping the sound of the bass is the pickup system. With this instrument, you have your choice of active or passive pickups. The difference is simple: an active pickup contains a small built-in preamp, while a passive pickup sends an untouched signal directly to the output. The end result is that passive pickups deliver a classic, full tone that works well with any amp while active pickups put out bright, clear sounds with added power to push an amp into high overdrive if that's your thing. You can also decide between fretted and fretless styles for your 4-string bass guitar. With a fretted fingerboard, the guitar neck is divided into semi-tones and you've got a visual and tactile guide for your finger placement. This makes fretted models easy to learn on, and the pinpoint contact with the metal frets can impart a clear, precise quality to the bass' sound. A fretless fingerboard, by comparison, is a great choice for experienced players, where you'll take advantage of the smooth surface to slide your fingers for more dynamic sounds. By pressing the string directly against the fingerboard wood, a fretless bass also gives you a slightly softer sound.",
      "No matter what style of bass you decide on—solid or semi-hollow, active or passive, fretted or fretless—the most important thing to keep in mind is that it's perfectly suited to your own tastes. If you're not sure where to start, take a look at some of your favorite bassists and see what they play: the first step to following in your idols' footsteps is to look for a matching bass guitar to put yourself on the same footing.",

      "When you come right down to it, an audio interface is anything that lets you get audio signals in and out of your computer. The challenge in picking one is that there are so many ways of getting it done, and it will all depend on how you like to work and what you're trying to do. A very basic interface would be simply a box that converted analog audio to digital audio that the recording software in your computer can understand, and convert it back to analog audio when you want to hear it. Such converters are referred to as AD/DA (analog to digital/digital to analog) converters. Better quality converters have what's called 'jitter correction' to compensate for small timing variations.",
      "Most interfaces are far more than just converter boxes. They include mic preamps, multiple I/O (Input/Output) connections—balanced, unbalanced and digital—and even internal DSP (Digital Signal Processing) for effects, EQ and basic monitor or sub-mixing user. Some units can even act as a simple, stand-alone mixer without a computer attached for use as a basic live sound mixer.",
      "One of the biggest determinants of overall audio quality in an audio interface is the quality of opamps (operational amplifiers) used in construction. Better systems will use lower-noise, lower-distortion components, or in some cases, discrete components rather than single-chip solutions. The number of I/O connections can be a deciding factor. The basic interfaces will be 2-in/2-out, able to handle a vocal and instrument together or a stereo pair of mics for capturing a live event. From there, you can expand as far as you need, depending on what you want to invest in your system. Interfaces with 18 inputs and 22 outputs are not uncommon and will handle most users needs, but you can go far larger with a full-blown Pro Tools HD rig, if that's what is required.",
      "The final consideration is connectivity. There are multiple ways of connecting an audio interface to your computer—USB, FireWire, a PCI slot for desktop systems or Apple's Thunderbolt connection on newer Macintosh computers—all of which have different strengths and weaknesses. USB interfaces tend to be smaller, with most mobile interfaces using USB connections, but can be less robust when you need a lot of simultaneous ins and outs. FireWire, also called IEEE 1394, is fast and robust, but generally requires an external power supply. PCI cards are the fastest with the most bandwidth, but are tied to tower and desktop systems, so will be confined to a single studio location. Some of the more popular brands for interfaces are Akai, Apogee, Avid, Focusrite, M-Audio, MOTU, Presonus, Roland, Tascam and Yamaha, though there are many others. The best interface is the one you're going to use, so spend some time with the Pro Audio specialists at Guitar Center so they can help you find exactly the right one.",
      "In addition to the mainstream audio interfaces described above, our GC Pro team of experts offers hands-on sales and support for professional solutions such as Avid HDX Systems and the Focusrite Rednet series. These solutions are typically used in recording studios, post facilities and other professional settings.",

      "The standard bass guitar is one of the music world's most commonly-used and well-loved instruments, played in virtually every genre to contribute the deep, resonant background adding energy to any song. If you're a musician who wants to take things up a notch, however, even an instrument as popular as the bass has room for change. With the 5-string electric bass, that change comes in the form of an added string. This variation on the bass guitar was pioneered in the mid-60s by Fender and quickly began to make waves in the funk, metal and rock scenes, among others. By installing a fifth string, the range of the instrument is expanded, allowing the 5-string bass to play an even bigger role in a melody than its 4-string cousins. Not only does this give you access to more chords and allow you to play higher melodies, it also gives you a wider range that can translate to some amazing bass solos. Like any bass guitar, the selection of tonewood is an important part of shaping the instrument's overall sound. Alder remains the classic choice, giving full, clear and balanced tones for versatility that easily adapts to any genre.",
      "To take full advantage of the 5-string bass' harmonic overtones, ash wood is another great option. Consider basswood if you like your sustain low, or maple if you like it high. Ultimately, the tonewood is a personal choice and it's a good idea to listen to different guitars to let your ear tell you which one is right for your own. Where the wood is one half of the bass' tonal equation, its pickups are the other half. Your 5-string bass guitar will come with either passive or active pickups, and while both types sound great, there is a difference in character to take into account. If you're looking to overdrive your amp for big distortion while maintaining tight control over the sound, you'll want to look at some active pickups. These contain their own mini-preamp to put a big punch behind the signal before it even gets to the main amp. On the other hand, if you want your tone to have classic warmth and fullness or vintage bass sound, passive pickups should top your list. When all is said and done, your goal is to find the 5-string electric bass guitar that perfectly matches your own preferences and is a great fit for the genres you play. Think about the wood and pickups you'd like as well as the wide variety of styles available and you'll find your instrument at the sweet spot where they all come together.",

Add a second Thump215—and the appropriate mixer—and you can power the live performance of an entire band. An onboard feedback eliminator guards against squeals, shrieks and howling, and a handy music-ducking mode automatically reduces the output level of channel 2 when channel 1 sees an input signal. There’s no need to adjust your playback system to make on-mic announcements. The Thump215 looks great, but the practical, angled cabinet isn’t simply for style.

      "About PA Speakers:",
      "'PA,' even though we still commonly use it, is really a rather outdated term. It originally was an abbreviation for 'Public Address,' like the announcement speakers in the airport or at a baseball stadium—not exactly the sound quality you want for your music. 'Sound reinforcement' sounds so much better, as do modern speaker cabinets.",
      "From portable setups to arena-sized concert systems, the technology of sound reinforcement has evolved in a major way over the years. Today's cabinets are lighter, louder, and better-sounding than ever. New materials and computer-aided design have revolutionized how sound is delivered at all budget levels.",
      "Today, when considering new cabinets, one of the major questions is whether to go with active or passive cabinets. Passive cabinets are what were traditionally thought of as PA cabinets—speakers in a box. A passive cabinet needs at least one external power amp, more if you want a bi-amplified system, with an external electronic crossover and separate power amps for the low- and high-frequency program material. Passive systems require a little more setup time and care, and require carting more gear, but compensate by being just a little more flexible, especially when something fails, since you can just move it to a different power amp or swap out a speaker fairly quickly and get back to the show.",
      "Active cabinets have power amps and electronic crossovers built into the cabinet, so you can hook directly from the outputs of your mixing board to the input of the speaker. They can also be daisy-chained, so it's easy to expand your system to whatever size you need for a particular venue. Many newer active cabinets use lightweight neodymium drivers and equally light Class-D digital power amps to keep weight down. Some of these new cabinets can provide 1000 watts or more of power in a cabinet that weighs less than 40 pounds. They make for a fast, easy setup and easy custom configurations for different venues.",
      "Also readily available are lightweight, powerful subwoofers—a big help with music that absolutely requires huge bass. Available both in active and passive versions, modern subs are also smaller, lighter and louder, packing more sound into less cubic footage than ever.",

Today, all you have to do is plug into a computer running the music software that's relevant to the task.

These can open up new possibilities for music software that you already use regularly, allowing you to get more out of it. If you're a producer or studio engineer, take a look at the professional-grade sound workshop software like Avid Pro Tools, Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live and Propellerhead Reason.

      "When digital became the standard for music, it naturally followed that the DJ booth went digital too. If you're an experienced DJ, you might remember when analog turntables and mixers were still the way to go. If you're new, you're starting out at a pretty exciting time. Today's digital DJ controllers and interfaces give you more tools and effects to work with than ever before. At the heart of most DJ setups are the turntables. Most of the controllers you'll find here are digital turntable MIDI controllers, giving you some of the functions of a standard control surface together with the jog wheels to stand in for vinyl records when you want to scratch. There are also some compact models, like the Numark ORBIT, with a single jog wheel to make them more portable. Whether you're looking for power or portability, there are controllers designed to deliver it.",
      "You'll also find pad-style DJ controllers for mixing, looping and managing individual tracks and samples. A pad can be your main controller if you don't scratch or if you use an analog turntable. You can also use it as a supplement alongside a jog wheel controller to add more functions like percussion effects. If some of your equipment is analog and some is digital, an interface will let you connect it all together. For example, you could use a DJ interface to connect a vinyl or CD turntable to your computer to record, mix and sample digitally. Or, you might use one to rip your music on vinyl to digital formats so that you can use it with a digital turntable controller. Some of those controllers even have interfaces built in. Of all the digital equipment you'll use as a professional DJ, controllers and interfaces are probably the most important. Together with your hardware or software sound units, mixers, synths and sequencers, they play a crucial role as part of the modern DJ toolbox.",

A full-sized orchestra typically has between 70 and 100 members and well over half of those chairs are dedicated to musicians who play the orchestral strings. The orchestral string section is made up of the following instruments: violin, viola, cello, double bass and harp. And while they all may belong to the same family, they each bring their own unique voice to the orchestra as a whole. In this catalog you're going to find everything from beginner to professional instruments to all the gear and equipment you need to keep them in top playing condition.",

A great option for student musicians, outfits come with everything needed to begin your orchestral string journey. Take for example, the Cremona SV-75 Premier Novice Series Violin Outfit. Not only does this outfit come with a student-level violin that features a super-fun sparkle finish, it also includes a case and bow to match. Are you a novice cellist? Check out the Knilling Perfection I Cello Outfit and the Etude Student Series Cello Outfit; both come ready to play with bows and gig bags.",

The Florea LA8170 Violin Bridge, the String Centre Adjustable Violin Bridge and Glaesel Self-Adjusting Violin Bridges are fantastic choices because they are affordable and offer an exceptional fit for your violin. Or, if the double bass is your instrument of choice, the String Centre Aurolar Hard Maple Bass Bridge or the Glaesel Self-Adjusting Bass Bridge with Wheels may be best for you.",

Whether you're a student musician in search of their first violin, a cellist looking for a spare set of strings or a harpist who needs a case for their instrument, you're going to find exactly what you want right here.",

      "When is a speaker not just a speaker? When it's a studio monitor. To the average person, there might not seem to be much difference, but music professionals know better. When you're working in the studio, you need to be able to hear your sound with complete clarity to make sure the recording will sound great even on high-fi audio systems. Studio monitors are designed for that purpose—when every note is crucial and every vocal has to be just right, you need a playback system that reproduces every nuance of the sound. Studio monitors come in two varieties: powered (or active) and unpowered (passive). When making your decision, it's important to know the difference.",
      "Powered monitors have an onboard amplifier, which enables them to perform simply by being plugged in to a power outlet and an audio source. That makes powered monitors easy to set up, so they're a good choice for a hobby studio or for audiophiles looking to get the best sound quality they can when listening to their favorite tunes.",
      "Unpowered monitors, on the other hand, need an external amplifier to work. If you're a discerning pro, you might prefer unpowered monitors for the ability to use the same amp head in the studio that you use onstage. An unpowered studio monitor also helps to minimize interference and buzz, since there are no electrical power components in the monitor's cabinet itself. Whichever type of monitor sounds best for you, make sure to take size and power into account. If your studio is small, a compact pair of monitors should do the trick. If you're working with a bigger soundstage, or shopping for monitors to use as home stereo speakers, you'll probably want to go larger. Another thing to keep in mind is where on the spectrum your music sits.",
      "If you have a lot of low-end frequencies in your sound, go for monitors with bigger woofers to make sure they deliver the punchiest bass. Finally, since some monitors are sold individually and others are sold in a pair, make sure you're picking up two for a stereo setup. A good studio monitor isn't limited to just the studio—you can use it anywhere you want high-quality playback, whether that's for recreational listening at home or professional sound booth use. Powerful enough monitors can even stand in for a speaker stack in smaller venues. However you plan to put them to use, your monitors are as personal a choice as your mixing gear, controllers and instruments, so finding the best ones to suit your needs is just as crucial.",

      "About Audio Mixers:",
      "Audio mixers can go from the sheer simplicity of a mono summing mixer, with a bunch of inputs and a single output with a knob to control output volume to the complexity of a multi-bus digital mixer with more built-in DSP power than a small recording studio such as the Behringer X32. So, it's kind of a big topic, and we'll try and break down a few basic categories to get you started.",
      "Line mixers are designed to handle, as you might suspect, line level signals. Most frequently, they're used as sub-mixers for things like multiple keyboard setups on stage or simple summing mixers. The things to look for in a line mixer are flexibility in connections and quality internal electronics—high-quality, low-noise op amps and capacitors. They tend to be fairly stripped down—no EQ, no inserts, no DSP—but are compact and very simple to use.",
      "Larger mixers, in addition to more channels, will start to have features like multiple sends, subgroups, and built-in DSP for effects. The EQ will also get more sophisticated and you'll begin to have assignable routing on channels and returns.",
      "Digital mixers start to hit the crossover point between live and studio mixing, with some intended to do both such as the Slate Raven MTI. These mixers have analog to digital conversion at the inputs and do everything in the digital world once the signal is in the board. They will have a USB or FireWire output so you can record the stereo mix directly to a computer system. They'll have more internal processing power, with some even doing some internal guitar amp or microphone modeling, giving you more options for sound. A convenient feature of many of these boards for live sound use is the ability to store presets, so you can easily recall the settings for a particular venue, saving a lot of setup and sound check time when you come back to someplace you play regularly.",
      "Many new mixers have connections to tablet computers, so you can use a tablet for remote mixing and touchpad control. New features keep popping up, so check with your Pro Audio department at Guitar Center to see just what the latest and greatest features are.",

      "When you play a guitar, bass, ukulele, mandolin or any other instrument in this big family, it's the vibration of the strings that creates your sound. That's common knowledge, of course, but have you ever stopped to really think about the implications? It's all too easy to dismiss your strings as just another part of your instrument, but the truth is they're more like its heart - and since playing the instrument means touching its strings, they also have a huge impact on the way it feels to play. With all that in mind, it's easy to see why the choice of strings is such an important one: it can make a massive difference in every aspect of your instrument, especially playability and tone. Picking out a new set of strings involves a number of choices, and those will depend on the specific instrument, so don't forget to filter the lineup by selecting a category. In most cases, that'll leave you with an easy-to-browse range of options - although if you're a guitarist or bassist, you'll still have hundreds to look at... and it might take a little more filtering to narrow things down further. Choosing your gauges will go a long way, not to mention material, which ranges from nylon for classical guitars to phosphor-bronze in acoustics and steel, nickel or even cobalt for electric guitars. ",
      "Another aspect of strings to consider in your decision is coating. Traditional coated strings have a smoother feel than their uncoated cousins and usually last much longer, but they're also wider and that can make them sound different. If you like the idea of coated strings, but don't want to give up the tone you get with uncoated ones, then check out Elixir and Cleartone strings: these two manufacturers have mastered the art of ultra-thin, 'barely-there' coatings that behave more like traditional strings. We've only just scratched the surface of what's available in this section, and there's a lot to see no matter what instrument you play. Different materials and gauges, coated or uncoated - it's up to you. You can buy your strings one at a time, go for a set or even stock up with multiple sets of strings at once. Still not sure where to begin? Try starting with the top-selling and best-rated strings and go from there. Finding the perfect set will probably take some experimentation, but there's no better guide than other musicians to get you on the right track.",
